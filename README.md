# simple-spider
A simple crawler for demonstration purposes.
This was supposed to be part of a one time lecture on Information Retrieval for highschool students.
Unfortunately I was not able to finish it in time.
As it is, it may still be a little too complicated anyway.
Maybe I will finish this project for the next lecture.
